Each domain receives a judgment of \n                    <em>Good</em>, <em>Adequate</em>, <em>Deficient</em>, <em>Not Reported</em> \n                    or <em>Critically Deficient</em> accompanied by the rationale and primary \n                    study-specific information supporting the judgment.&nbsp;Once all domains \n                    are evaluated, a confidence rating of <em>High</em>, <em>Medium</em>, or \n                    <em>Low</em> confidence or <em>Uninformative</em> is assigned for each \n                    endpoint/outcome from the study.&nbsp;The overall confidence rating \n                    should, to the extent possible, reflect interpretations of the potential \n                    influence on the results (including the direction and/or magnitude of \n                    influence) across all domains.&nbsp;The rationale supporting the overall \n                    confidence rating should be documented clearly and consistently, including \n                    a brief description of any important strengths and/or limitations that were \n                    identified and their potential impact on the overall confidence.</p>\n                    <p>Note that due to current limitations in HAWC, domain judgments and overall \n                    ratings for all individual endpoints/outcomes assessed in a study will need \n                    to be entered using a single drop-down selection and free-text box for each \n                    study. Thus, all the reviewer decisions (and the supporting rationale) drawn \n                    at the level of a specific cohort or individual endpoint within a study must \n                    be described within a single free-text box.&nbsp;Within the text boxes, please \n                    remember to call out each of the specific judgments and rationales. A good \n                    form to follow for the text boxes is '<strong><em>Endpoint/Outcome – Judgment \n                    – Rationale</em></strong>'. When selecting the representative rating for the \n                    domains and overall rating (i.e., the drop-down selection with the associated \n                    color code), it is typically most appropriate to select the judgment that \n                    best represents an average of the responses for the endpoint/outcome evaluated \n                    in that study, considering the pre-defined importance of individual \n                    outcomes/health effects to the assessment (see Overall Confidence examples).</p>\n                    <p>Follow <a href='https://hawcprd.epa.gov/assessment/100000039/' target='_blank'><strong>link</strong></a> \n                    to see attachments that contain example answers to the animal study evaluation domains. \n                    <em>It is really helpful to have this document open when conducting reviews.</em></p>\n                    <p>Follow <a href='https://hawcprd.epa.gov/assessment/100000039/' target='_blank'><strong>link</strong></a> \n                    to see attachments that contain example prompting and follow-up questions for epidemiological studies.</p>\n                ", help_text='Detailed instructions for completing study evaluation assessments.'),
